<h2 id="ram-ram-gorbhai-who-are-the-banjaras">Ram Ram Gorbhai: Who are the Banjaras?</h2>

<p>Banjaras, also known as Gormati, are essentially a Rajput clan spread 
across India. Predominantly found in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, 
Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, their population is 
approximately 7 crores, which is equivalent to the combined population of 
Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.</p>

<p>The culture and traditions of the Banjaras are similar to the Rajput clan, 
evident in their worship of Bhavani, which underscores their Rajput 
origins. Despite different classifications in various states, it does not 
imply they belong to a lower caste.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-social-status">Understanding Social Status</h3>

<p>I want to address my Gormati brothers: Why do you always identify as ST 
when someone asks about your caste? Are you truly ST? It’s crucial to 
understand that ST, SC, BC, and OC classifications are based on economic 
status, not caste. If you believe you are ST, why do our Gormatis fall 
under different categories in different states?</p>

<h3 id="a-personal-anecdote">A Personal Anecdote</h3>

<p>Once, I was traveling from my village to the city and had to walk or take 
an auto or bicycle for about 5 km. I decided to walk and encountered a boy 
pedaling a bike. I requested to join him and offered to pedal for him up 
to the main road. He agreed, and when I asked him about his caste, he 
replied, “I am ST.” I was surprised, not because he identified as ST, but 
because he was a school student saying ST instead of 
Gormati/Banjara/Lambadi. We need to understand that we are degrading 
ourselves, not anyone else.</p>

<h3 id="embracing-our-identity">Embracing Our Identity</h3>

<p>Consider this: if you ask a Kapu, Naidu, or Velamma person about their 
caste, they will proudly say, “I am Kapu” or “I am Naidu.” Recently, when 
actor Pawan Kalyan’s movie “Bheemla Nayak” was released, leaders from the 
Banjara community expressed pride because Pawan Kalyan played a character 
from the ST community. This reflects how some political leaders criticize 
our identity, which influences even primary school students’ 
understanding.</p>

<h3 id="a-call-to-action">A Call to Action</h3>

<p>My request to our Gormati brothers is simple: Respect our culture and be 
proud to be Gormati.</p>
