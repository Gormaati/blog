<h1>Introduction to the Gormati Community</h1>
<img src="banjara.jpg" alt="Banjara Community" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
<p><b>Ram Ram Gorbhai: Who are the Banjaras?</b></p>
<p>Banjaras, also known as Gormati, are essentially a Rajput clan spread across India. Predominantly found in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, their population is approximately 7 crores, which is equivalent to the combined population of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p><b>Cultural and Traditional Ties</b></p>
<p>The culture and traditions of the Banjaras are similar to the Rajput clan, evident in their worship of Bhavani, which underscores their Rajput origins. Despite different classifications in various states, it does not imply they belong to a lower caste.</p>
<p><b>Understanding Social Status</b></p>
<p>I want to address my Gormati brothers: Why do you always identify as ST when someone asks about your caste? Are you truly ST? It's crucial to understand that ST, SC, BC, and OC classifications are based on economic status, not caste. If you believe you are ST, why do our Gormatis fall under different categories in different states?</p>
<p><b>A Personal Anecdote</b></p>
<p>Once, I was traveling from my village to the city and had to walk or take an auto or bicycle for about 5 km. I decided to walk and encountered a boy pedaling a bike. I requested to join him and offered to pedal for him up to the main road. He agreed, and when I asked him about his caste, he replied, "I am ST." I was surprised, not because he identified as ST, but because he was a school student saying ST instead of Gormati/Banjara/Lambadi. We need to understand that we are degrading ourselves, not anyone else.</p>
<p><b>Embracing Our Identity</b></p>
<p>Consider this: if you ask a Kapu, Naidu, or Velamma person about their caste, they will proudly say, "I am Kapu" or "I am Naidu." Recently, when actor Pawan Kalyan's movie "Bheemla Nayak" was released, leaders from the Banjara community expressed pride because Pawan Kalyan played a character from the ST community. This reflects how some political leaders criticize our identity, which influences even primary school students' understanding.</p>
<p><b>A Call to Action</b></p>
<p>My request to our Gormati brothers is simple: Respect our culture and be proud to be Gormati.</p>
