<h1>Introduction to the Gormatti Community</h1>
<img src="Tulja_bhavani.jpg" alt="Banjara Community" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 25%; height: 50%;">
<p><b>Ram Ram Gorbhai: Who are the Banjaras?</b></p>
<p>Banjaras, also known as Gormatti, are essentially a Rajput clan spread across India. Predominantly found in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, their population is approximately 7 crores, which is equivalent to the combined population of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p><b>Cultural and Traditional Ties</b></p>
<p>The culture and traditions of the Banjaras are reminiscent of the Rajput clan, as evidenced by their worship of Bhavani. This connection to Bhavani reflects their Rajput origins, including the use of certain names and surnames that underscore this heritage. Although the Banjaras are classified differently in various states, these classifications do not imply that they belong to a lower caste.</p>
<p><b>Understanding Social Status</b></p>
<p>I want to address my Gormatti brothers: Why do you always identify as ST when someone asks about your caste? Are you truly ST? It's crucial to understand that ST, SC, BC, and OC classifications are based on economic status, not caste. If you believe you are ST, why do our Gormattis fall under different categories in different states?</p>
<p><b>A Personal Anecdote</b></p>
<p>Once, while traveling from my village to the city, I had to either walk, take an auto, or ride a bicycle for about 5 km. I decided to walk and soon encountered a boy pedaling a bicycle. I asked if I could join him and offered to pedal for him up to the main road. He agreed. When I inquired about his identity, he replied, "I am ST." I was taken aback, not because he identified as ST, but because he was a school student referring to himself with the abbreviation ST instead of mentioning his community, such as Gormatti, Banjara, or Lambadi. This incident made me realize that we are contributing to our own degradation, not anyone else.</p>
<p><b>Embracing Our Identity</b></p>
<p>Consider this: if you ask someone from communities like Kapu, Naidu, or Velamma about their caste, they will proudly say, "I am Kapu" or "I am Naidu," even though they belong to the BC category. When actor Pawan Kalyan played the lead role in the movie "Bheemla Nayak," which was associated with the Banjara community, some political leaders referred to it as representing the ST category, rather than acknowledging that he portrayed a character from the Banjara or Gormatti community. This reflects how criticisms from political leaders about our identity can influence even the understanding of primary school students. It underscores the need to address how such narratives shape perceptions and self-identification.</p>
<p><b>A Call to Action</b></p>
<p>My request to our Gormatti brothers and sisters is simple: Respect our culture and be proud to be Gormatti. Many people use the status of Banjara to secure jobs and university admissions but are ashamed to speak our own language. So, please, do not be ashamed of our culture and language. You were born as a Banjara/Gormatti, so take pride in your identity and raise your voice as a Gormatti. Remember, you are not aloneâ€”there are around 70 million people who stand with you in support.</p>
